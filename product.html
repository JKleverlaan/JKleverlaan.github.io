				<h2>What problem does it solve</h2>
				<p>
					No matter if it's broadcast or decision making if it's sports there is some Hawk-eye technologie involved.
					For broadcast it wil be the MARS sending footage from all sides and angles to broadcasters all over the world.
					If it's decission making it will be the hawk-eye cameras and computers allowing for instant replay's and slowmotion
					to check exactly what happened at the exact moment. The time for a referee to make a decision is also much shorter
					than it was before because the people checking the cameras can immediatly give data to the referee.

				<h2>How to use the hawk-eye</h2>
				<p>
					Normal people won't be able to get they're hands on a hawk-eye, but if your a sports orginasation or
					you work at the company, you yourself won't be using it. hawk-eye will send a group of people who will
					train a group of employees to be able to use it, but what it is, is just a big console so you can pinpoint
					the time that you have to check and MARS is a computer system that automatically send footage to broadcasters
					so you won't have to use that either.
